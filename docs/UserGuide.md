# AB-3 User Guide

AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is a **desktop application for managing contacts, optimized for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type quickly, AB3 can help you manage contacts faster than traditional GUI applications.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure that Java `25` or later is installed on your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a terminal, `cd` to the folder containing the JAR file, and run `java -jar addressbook.jar`.<br>
   A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. For example, type **`help`** and press Enter to open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/Ryan Tan p/+6591234567 s/Mathematics l/Secondary 4` : Adds a student named `Ryan Tan`.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  For example, in `add n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with a value such as `John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  For example, `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items followed by `...` can appear zero or more times.<br>
  For example, `[t/TAG]... ` may be omitted, or written as `t/friend` or `t/friend t/family`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  For example, if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that take no parameters, such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`, are ignored.<br>
  For example, `help 123` is interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Viewing help: `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a student: `add`

Adds a student to TutorRoster and shows the full roster with the new student. The result area shows
`New student added: NAME`.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE [e/EMAIL] s/SUBJECT [s/SUBJECT]... l/LEVEL`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Email is optional. Supply at least one subject; repeat `s/` for additional subjects.
Parameters may appear in any order. Only `s/` may be repeated.
</box>

Examples:
* `add n/Ryan Tan p/+6591234567 e/ryan@example.com s/Mathematics l/Secondary 4`
* `add n/Alicia Lim p/81234567 s/Mathematics s/Physics l/JC 1`
* `add l/Grade 8 s/English n/Sarah Lee p/+821012345678`

Names are 1–100 characters after surrounding and repeated whitespace is normalized. They may contain
Unicode letters and numbers, spaces, apostrophes, hyphens, and full stops, and must contain a letter or number.
Phone numbers contain 3–15 digits, optionally preceded by `+`, with no spaces or hyphens.
Email, when supplied, has one `@`, a non-empty local part, and a domain with at least one full stop and
non-empty text between full stops; whitespace is not allowed.
Each subject is 1–50 characters and may contain letters, numbers, spaces, `&`, `+`, `/`, apostrophes,
hyphens, and full stops. Levels are 1–30 characters and may contain letters, numbers, spaces, and hyphens.
Subjects and levels are trimmed at the ends; internal spaces and capitalization are preserved.

The same subject cannot appear twice in one command, ignoring case and surrounding whitespace.
A new student is rejected as a duplicate when another new-format student has the same normalized name
and either the same phone number or the same email address. Email comparison ignores case, and an initial
`+` is ignored when comparing phone numbers. Existing legacy records do not block new students.

Missing required parameters show `Invalid command format. Usage: add n/NAME p/PHONE [e/EMAIL] s/SUBJECT [s/SUBJECT]... l/LEVEL`.
An unknown prefix shows `Unknown parameter prefix: PREFIX`; repeating `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, or `l/` shows
`Parameter PREFIX must not be specified more than once.` An empty `e/` is invalid.
A duplicate student shows `This student already exists in TutorRoster.`
If saving fails, TutorRoster shows `Unable to save student data. No changes were made.`

### Listing all persons: `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book.

Format: `list`

### Editing a person: `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]... `

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, all of the person's existing tags are removed; adding tags is not cumulative.
* To remove all of a person's tags, enter `t/` without a tag after it.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive; for example, `hans` matches `Hans`.
* Keyword order does not matter; for example, `Hans Bo` matches `Bo Hans`.
* The search considers only names.
* Partial names match too; for example, `Han` matches `Hans`, and `lex` matches `Alex`.
* Persons matching at least one keyword are returned (an `OR` search); for example, `Hans Bo` returns `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang`.

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find aLe` matches `Alex Yeoh` regardless of case.
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

### Deleting a student: `delete`

Removes a student from TutorRoster's active roster.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* The index is a positive integer starting from 1 and refers to the currently displayed list.
* After a `find` command, use the index shown in the search results.
* After deletion, the complete remaining roster is displayed in its original order with updated indices.
* The result area shows `Student removed: NAME`, for example `Student removed: Ryan Tan`.
* Deleting the last student leaves an empty roster.
* Deletion takes effect immediately, without a confirmation dialog.
* To replace outdated information, delete the record and add the corrected record.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` removes the second student in the full roster.
* `find Ryan` followed by `delete 1` removes the first student in the search results, then shows the full roster.

If no index is supplied, the index is malformed, or extra arguments are present (for example `delete 1 n/Ryan`),
the result area shows `Invalid command format. Usage: delete INDEX`.
If a positive index is outside the displayed list, it shows `The student index provided is invalid.`.
In either case, the roster and displayed list remain unchanged.

### Adding or removing a remark: `remark`

Changes the remark of the student at an index in the currently displayed list.

Format: `remark INDEX r/REMARK`

* The index is a positive integer starting from 1. After `find`, it refers to the search results.
* A new remark replaces the previous one. Use `remark INDEX r/` to remove it.
* After a successful change, the complete roster is displayed.

Examples:
* `remark 2 r/Likes baseball` adds a remark to the second displayed student.
* `remark 2 r/` removes that student's remark.

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook automatically saves data after every command. You do not need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes make the data file invalid, AddressBook starts with an empty address book at the next run. The invalid file remains on disk until you run a command (AddressBook saves after every command). Still, we recommend backing up the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the data file it creates with the data file from your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
